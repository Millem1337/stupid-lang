# Stupid language
For the coolest (no) programming language, you need to install the "Nim" (https://nim-lang.org) programming language on your PC.

Next, you must download the `main.nim` file and open the console. Next, you must create the `test.stupid` file. After that, you must enter this command into the console: 
`$ nim c .\main.nim`

After that you can open the compiled file.
